This specific one is for guessing the names of characters in the Harry Potter franchise. 

Comments About Each File
------------

### ← index.html

This is the code for the main page. I'm used to coding Javascript and parts of CSS directly within html file—they can be viewed within 
the "<script></script>" part and ""<style></style>" part respectively. 

### ← timeup.html

The page automatically loads to timeup.html once the time selected has passed. It tells you the player's score for the game. 
To get back to the main page, click on "Try Again" button.

### ← gamesover.html

This page loads when the player finishes before timer is up and clicks on the "Finish Game" button. Like in the timeup.html file, 
the score and "Try Again" button shows. 

### ← style.css

Contains the Harry Potter-specific fonts to be used across all html files.
